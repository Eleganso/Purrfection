    <h1>
      Once uppon a time there was some cute kitties in the dark winter night.
    </h1>
    <p>
      <br />

      Dont forget to highlight text if not readable.Dont mind the typos and
      syntax.This text have to stay in the left side <br />of the screen
      also.Fix this with CSS.Im writing a long text just to format <br />it.No
      need to continue reading...Yes its pointless...Keep scrolling...More
      text.Dont make it to the<br />
      end.Its pointless.Like a newspaper in a movie.No need to read.So dont<br />
      forget "w3schools.com" for help creating HTML CSS Javascript and more.Okay
      some more<br />
      text and we will need to put some kitty picture here. <br />Okay we found
      a way to go to the next lane with the "br" command.But we need more easy
      way with CSS.
    </p>
    <div class="text">
      <pre>
Okay, guys, so we got this new function
    we can jump on new lines whenever we want
    with the "pre" command.Made for poems.
    Still on the search for knowedge and power.We
    also need to change to color of the text to read to be more visible.
  </pre
      >
      <p>
        Now we need to add second page for the purrrrrr.More mewwwws here <br />
        and more purrssss there.So far we control little to non where the heck
        everything goes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="rightText">
      <pre>
        Now we have to put put this text to the
        right side.Put some color as usual.And figure what to be the next pago for.
      </pre>
    </div>
