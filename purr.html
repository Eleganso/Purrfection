            Title: Jingle Paws

            In a cozy home with lights aglow,
            A purr-fect scene covered in snow.
            Cats with fur as white as the flakes,
            Gather 'round for sweet Christmas bakes.
            
            Jingle paws, a festive melody,
            Softly sung by feline company.
            Whiskers twitch to the carol's beat,
            As Santa's sleigh nears, light and fleet.
            
            Underneath the twinkling tree,
            Furry presents, a sight to see.
            Gifts of catnip and playful toys,
            Bring endless feline holiday joys.
            
            Santa Claws, with a snowy beard,
            Leaves treats for each whisker-eared.
            Chasing tinsel, a playful game,
            Christmas for cats is never the same.
            
            On a cozy blanket, they all repose,
            Dreaming of mice and sparkling bows.
            As the fire crackles, warm and bright,
            Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
